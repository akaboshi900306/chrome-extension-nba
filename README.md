## Motivation

Sports websites don't usually have a convenient way to find out the latest box score.
This extension is for people who just want to get the latest update but too lazy to look it up.

## Features
1. Daily box score on the popup page
1. Full schedule list for the season
1. Ability to add favorite team which will be shown on top of the daily list
1. Playoff bracket for each season
1. Dark mode

## TODOs
- [] Use build scripts
- [] Convert into to use React
- [] Add highlights to box score page
- [] Add the ability to sort tables
